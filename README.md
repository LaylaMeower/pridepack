# PridePack
This is PridePack. A Resource Pack made by [Pridecraft Studios](https://github.com/pridecraft-studios). We make Minecraft Gay.
We also make some mods, such as [Paladin's Furniture Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/paladins-furniture). If you want to see your  or any other mod be gayed without making it look like all flat rainbows, create an [Issue](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/pridepack/issues/new) on GitHub detailing your suggestion.
