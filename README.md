# Pride Pack (3.0)
This is a Pride Themed Minecraft Resource Pack.
It has many colored blocks switched to Pride Flags and even changes Music Disks to have LGBT songs (in note block cover).
## Why new page
You might have seen my previous "Pride Pack" packs, but i decided to make a new page to update it to "CanalNu" branding and other stuff. Also to force TLMods literally tell you to not use it :skull:
## Why exists
Because pride. If you're asking "Why lgbt pride exists", get out of here.
## Can we has screenshots
Yes.
