# Pride Pack (3.0)
This is a Pride Themed Minecraft Resource Pack.
It has many colored blocks switched to Pride Flags and even changes Music Disks to have LGBT songs (in note block cover). The Curseforge Version 3.0.0.TL will have something special.
## Why new page
You might have seen my previous "Pride Pack" packs, but i decided to make a new page to update it to "CanalNu" branding and other stuff. Also to force TLMods literally tell you to not use it :skull:
Again, if you are using [T](https://youtu.be/SBTH9n6lz9o)[L](https://youtu.be/GPpt1K7OP3A)[M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLXR9SMtv2M&pp=ugMICgJwdBABGAE=)[o](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/nay62e/comment/gxy9rr5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[d](https://www.reddit.com/r/TLAUNCHER/comments/hyqm1y/comment/hh3sau8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[s](https://web.archive.org/web/20220802105729/https://minecraftmain.ru/2018/02/tlauncher-story?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en), please don't.
## Why exists
Because pride. If you're asking "Why lgbt pride exists", get out of here.
The new page also exists to force [T](https://youtu.be/SBTH9n6lz9o)[L](https://youtu.be/GPpt1K7OP3A)[M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLXR9SMtv2M&pp=ugMICgJwdBABGAE=)[o](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/nay62e/comment/gxy9rr5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[d](https://www.reddit.com/r/TLAUNCHER/comments/hyqm1y/comment/hh3sau8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[s](https://web.archive.org/web/20220802105729/https://minecraftmain.ru/2018/02/tlauncher-story?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en) to clone the Curseforge page and tell it's users to  no longer be.
